## Make a spec for the last example in the README.

### For publication of Gem 

Add slowness warning to readme


### Optimize

* define_method is twice as slow as eval

* Forwardable seems twice as slow too

Need to setup a benchmark setup to compare alternative implementations, maybe a fastforwarder?

* Edit fast specs and make them pass
  unit:    ok
  functional: not started yet
  acceptance: not started yet

* Then define first benchmarks and work away on them
