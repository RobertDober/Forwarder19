# Implement to_hash

## Add chains as to_hash arguments

## Possibly add key_required feature

## Acceptence Specs finished

## Get down into unit (functional if needed) specs

### And think about to_all implementation for to_hash

# Get rid of specs using Argument#delegatable?

# Use Byte code compilation

# Check if attr can be made faster by bytecode compilation
