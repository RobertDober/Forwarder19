## Make a spec for the last example in the README.


### Implement features

#### AOP


##### Check the interaction of the following argument parameters and unit spec them

   &lt;aop>: :use_block
   &amp;blk
   with_block:

use_block shall only get &amp;block, not with_block, thus they can be combined, unit
and acceptance spec this.

#### Custom Targets


### Optimize

define_method is twice as slow as eval
